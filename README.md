# Time-Series-Analysis
Basic time series analysis and forecasting.

# Dataset

The dataset schema contains the number of air passengers from 1949 to 1960 for every month. The data exhibited both an increasing trend and seasonality.

# Model Building

-Training has been done with an Manual ARIMA model and techniques like moving average and differencing were used to convert the available  time series into a stationary time series. 
- Implemented Auto ARIMA model to consider the seasonality factor and to select the optimized value for ARIMA(p,d,q).
- The final prediction had an RMSE of 52. 1841
